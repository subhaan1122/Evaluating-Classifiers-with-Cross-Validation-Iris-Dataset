🌸 Iris Classification Using Multiple ML Models:

This project evaluates the performance of various classification algorithms — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest — on the popular Iris dataset using cross-validation.

📌 Project Overview:

The Iris dataset is a classic in machine learning, consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers classified into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
Each sample contains four features:

- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

In this project, we:

- Apply four different machine learning models.
- Use cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
- Compare the average accuracy of each model.

🚀 Algorithms Used:

- Model &	Description:
Logistic Regression	: Linear model for multi-class classification
Decision Tree: 	Tree-based model for learning simple rules
Support Vector: Classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane
Random Forest: 	Ensemble of Decision Trees

🧠 Tech Stack:

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy

📂 Dataset Used:

Iris Dataset Provided directly by scikit-learn via load_iris().

📊 Results:

After evaluating each model using cross-validation we got different results.

📚 Learnings:

- How to load and work with built-in datasets using scikit-learn.
- How to apply multiple classifiers.
- How to perform and evaluate models using cross-validation.
- Model comparison using average accuracy.
